#What is Nusademy?
Nusademy is ecosystem platform that provides a new way of learning for Indonesia's young generation.

#Executive Summary
The lack of young Indonesian’s reading interests, low teachers quality, and the difficulties of passion discovery make educational inequality grow higher in Indonesia. It raises questions as to why young Indonesians’ reading interest keeps decreasing, how to increase both their reading interest and choosing teaching as their life paths. Passion discovery becomes more difficult for young people. In reality, pursuing things people do not enjoy doing affects the end results. These problems raise the team’s awareness to contribute more for young Indonesians in terms of building the right character and national identity of Indonesians with respect to the country’s values. 

#Project Scope
Create mobile applications that provide a new way of learning for Indonesian Young Generation to tackle low quality of teachers, low reading interest, and young talent which don't know their passion.
